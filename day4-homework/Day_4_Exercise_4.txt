1) For the line plot I named Day_4_Exercise_2.png (titled Genetic Drift, x-axis = # generations, y-axis = allele frequency), which contains the line plots of today's Exercise 2:
	The plot shows 30 iterations of my code simulating the genetic drift in a population that started with an allele frequency of 0.5 and a 
	population size of 1754 (which also happens to be my lunch number from elementarys school. But that is an unrealted point). Since I started the
	allele frequency at 0.5, it makes sense that it takes quite a while in terms of number of generation to reach fixation for each iteration, and 
	the odds that the allele will fix to 1 or 0 (become fixed in the population or disappear) are about equal. That's why we don't see any significant
	trend in one direction or the other. If the population size had been smaller, the alleles would have likely fixed in less generations, while if it
	had been larger, it would have taken longer.

2) For the histogram shown in the same file (Day_4_Exercise_2.png, titled Allele Fixation, x-axis = time to fixation, y-axis = distribution):
	The plot shows a histogram of the number of iterations of my genetic drift simulation code that took a certain amount of time to fixation. In real life, 
	the more generations that pass, the more likely it is that the allele will fix (one way or the other), which is why the peak of the histogram is skewed 
	to the left with fewer and fewer iterations having long times to fixation.

3) For the scatter plot shown in my file Day_4_Exercise_3_part_2.png (title = Exercise 3, x-axis = population size, y-axis = time to fixation):
	The plot shows a scatter of the time to fixation taken for an allele to fix in a population of a set size based on the starting allele frequency.
	Intuitively, alleles with frequencies closer to 0.5 will take the longest time to fix in a population (and they could fix either way, to 0 or 1), 
	while an allele with a very low frequency (close to 0) will likely disappear from the population (fix to 0) very fast, and an allele that starts 
	with a frequency close to 1 would likely fix to be present in the entire population within few generations.
