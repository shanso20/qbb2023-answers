Step 2: There were 176 peaks in the combined file. Sample 1 had 177 peaks, meaning 99.4% of the peaks were retained.
		Sample 2 had 198 peaks, meaning 88.9% of peaks were retained.

Step 3: The peaks between the samples seem mostly reproducible, but there are noticable differences in the heights and locations of some peaks. The p-value range of a peak is generally indicative of reproducibility, but it is by no means completely consistent.
